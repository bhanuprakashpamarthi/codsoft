## Introduction

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

In the first task, I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. My approach and code for this task can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bhanuprakashpamarthi/codsoft/tree/main/Task-1(Titanic_survival_prediction))

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

Task 2 involved predicting movie ratings, a fascinating challenge that allowed me to dive into recommendation systems. Through data preprocessing and model building, I aimed to create a predictive model for movie ratings. You can explore the code and details on [GitHub](https://github.com/bhanuprakashpamarthi/codsoft/tree/main/Task-2(Movie_Rating_Prediction))

## Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

The final task revolved around Credit Card Fraud Detection, a critical application of machine learning in finance. I implemented models to identify fraudulent transactions, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance financial security. The code and insights are available on [GitHub][(https://github.com/bhanuprakashpamarthi/codsoft/tree/main/Task-3%20(Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection))]
